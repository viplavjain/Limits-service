This code snippet processes promotional reference data for a vision system. It takes a map containing key-value pairs representing the data, along with the feed name and asset type, and performs different actions based on the presence of a specific key in the map.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Function: processingpromoRefFeed

Date conversion: It checks for keys sor_promo_end_date and sor_promo_effec_date in the map. If present, it converts their values from UTC to local date format using a function getUTCToLocalDate (not shown).

Trim value: It trims any leading/trailing spaces from the value associated with the key sor_promo_scrn_cde in the map (if present).

Searching for COneID:

It creates instances of helper classes SearchRequestAdapter and VisionFeedTemplateProcessing.
It retrieves the sor_promo_id from the map and creates a list containing only this ID.
It calls the getCOneID function (explained later) to search for a document with this ID in the COne system using a specific context type, search field, and schema ID.
Processing based on COneID existence:

If a document is found in COne (meaning catalogOneIdVisionPromoRefList is not null and has elements):

It removes the key promo_display_name from the map (if present).
It retrieves the complete template from the COne system using the getGEETemplate function (explained later) with the COne ID found earlier.
It calls the createGeeFromDomainTemplate function (explained later) to populate the template with data from the map and other parameters.
It generates a success file using the generateFile function (explained later) with the ID, status ("update"), folder path, file name ("PROMO_VISION_FEED.txt"), and asset type.
If no document is found in COne:

It calls the createGeeFromExistingTemplate function (not shown) to create a new template based on existing configurations.
It generates a success file using the generateFile function with the ID, status ("create"), folder path, file name ("PROMO_VISION_FEED.txt"), and asset type.
Error handling:

If any exception occurs during processing, it logs the error message and throws the exception. It also calls functions for error notification (not shown).
Function: getCOneID

This function retrieves the COne ID for a given list of IDs (typically SKU IDs) based on a specific context type, search field, schema ID, and whether it's a linked asset.
It uses the SearchApiAdapter class to interact with the COne search API.
It builds the search request based on the provided parameters and calls the search API.
It parses the search response to extract COne document IDs and returns them as a list.
Function: getGEETemplate

This function retrieves a complete Generic Element Entry (GEE) template from the Amdocs Domain API using a COne ID.
It uses the com.vzw.epc.mapper.amdocs.domainApi.generic.ApiClient class to interact with the Domain API.
It builds the API request with authorization headers and base URL based on configuration properties.
It retrieves the GEE data for the provided COne ID and returns it as a JsonNode object.
Function: createGeeFromDomainTemplate

This function takes a GEE template (JsonNode), a map containing data, feed name, asset name, and COne ID as input.
It retrieves configuration properties for the asset name to determine how to map data from the input map to the template fields.
It iterates through the map entries and updates the corresponding fields in the template based on the mapping configuration.
It handles linked assets (assets that reference other assets) by searching for COne IDs of the linked asset values and updating the template accordingly.
Finally, it creates a file containing the populated GEE template in JSON format.
Function: generateFile

This function generates a file with specific information about the processed data.
It takes the ID, status ("create" or "update"), folder path, file name, and asset type as input.
It creates a file in the specified folder path with the provided file name.
It writes the ID, status, and asset type separated by pipes ("|") to the file in append mode.
It then
